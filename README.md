## About


Our primary objective was to provide the club with valuable insights into the team's performance on the field. To achieve this, we analyzed the: 
1. Expected threat, 
2. Passing networks and  
3. Player physical attributes. 

Our aim was to assist the coaching staff in gaining a better understanding of the team's strengths and weaknesses and identify areas for improvement. All thesewere also  implemented in a **Web Application** for easy access and interpretation by anyone. We are confident that our findings will provide the club with a competitive edge and help them continue to achieve success on the field. We appreciate your attendance today and look forward to presenting our results.
